        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>400g Coles beef oyster blade steak, cut into 4 large pieces</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small-medium brown onion (125g), thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, smashed, peeled</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Coles Brand Balsamic Vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup Campbell's Beef Stock, from 500ml tetra pack</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 bunch Hatters Coloured Carrots, scrubbed, halved lengthwise</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare the braised beef: Position the rack in the centre of the oven 
            <br>and preheat the oven to 150C (130C fan). Season the beef with salt and 
            <br>pepper. Heat a heavy medium casserole pot or Dutch oven over 
            <br>medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, then add the beef and 
            <br>cook, turning as needed, for about 10 minutes, or until the beef is brown 
            <br>on all sides. Remove the beef from the pot and pour off all but 1 tablespoon 
            <br>of the oil.</li>
            <li>Add the onion, rosemary, and garlic to the pot and cook, stirring to scrape up 
            <br>the brown bits on the bottom of the pot, for about 8 minutes, or until the onion 
            <br>is golden. Reduce the heat to medium, add the vinegar and then the stock, 
            <br>stirring to scrape up any remaining brown bits. Return the beef to the pot and 
            <br>the water to just cover the meat. Cover the pot and transfer it to the oven. 
            <br>Braise for about 2 hours, or until the meat is almost tender. Transfer the pot 
            <br>the stove top, carefully remove the lid. Increase the oven temperature to 
            <br>260C (240C fan).</li>
            <li>Simmer the beef mixture, uncovered, over medium heat for about 30 minutes, 
            <br>or until the beef is tender and the sauce has reduced to about one quarter of its 
            <br>original volume. Remove the rosemary stems. Season well with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, to roast the vegetables: On a heavy large baking tray, toss the carrots 
            <br>with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and season with salt and pepper. Arrange in an 
            <br>even layer over the baking tray and roast for about 10-12 minutes, or until 
            <br>crisp-tender. Toss the carrots with the parsley. Serve the carrots alongside the 
            <br>braised beef and braising liquid.</li>
        </ol>
